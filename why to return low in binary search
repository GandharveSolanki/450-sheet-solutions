35. Search Insert Position(Leetcode)

           1) If target is present then it will first reached by mid.
           2) If target is not present, then low and high will go towards its position.
                Last step both low and high equals and it enters  the loop. 
                So mid is also equals the low and high.
                If the the target is greater than it means we need to place mid+1 so low itself the answer.
                if the target is less than the mid. it means we can insert the target at mid i.e low.
                Therefore in both the cases low will be place to insert. 
                
                 int searchInsert(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
int low=0,high=nums.size()-1;
        while(low<=high)
        {
            int mid=(low+high)/2;
            if(nums[mid]==target)
            return mid;
            else if(nums[mid]>target)
            high=mid-1;
            else
            low=mid+1;
        }
        return low;
    }
