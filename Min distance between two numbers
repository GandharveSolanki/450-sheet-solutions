//see first of all the differnce here which will be the absolute values between the indexes will be minimum when the indexes lie close to each other
so you have to find those indexes of x and y which are closer to each other which inturn will provide you with the minimum differnce and rest it is not required to check
every index where x is found and take diff with indexes of y as again the indexes which lie close to each other will contribute to the minimum differnce ..


//code
int minDist(int arr[], int n, int x, int y) {
        // code here

int i,ans=INT_MAX;
int index1=-1,index2=-1;
for(i=0;i<n;i++)
{
    if(arr[i]==x)
    {
        index1=i;
    }
    if(arr[i]==y)
    {
        index2=i;
    }
    if(index1!=-1&&index2!=-1)
    {
        int temp=abs(index1-index2);
        ans=min(ans,temp);
    }
}
if(ans==INT_MAX)
return -1;
return ans;
